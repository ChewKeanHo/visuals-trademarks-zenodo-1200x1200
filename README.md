# Zenodo.org Trademarks Logo 1200x1200 | (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Visuals

[![logo](/Pictures/banner_1200x1200.svg)](#)

The Zenodo.org Trademarks Logo. They published great guidelines for deployment
and also supplied the preferred and usable `.svg` material files to work on.
`.svg` format has non-destructive scale up & down properties and can be
converted into any rasterized images (e.g. `jpeg`, `webp`, `avif`, etc).
However, the materials are oddly designed. Hence, for conforming to our
standards, a simple re-draw complying to their guidelines is suffice.

This project re-draws Zenodo.org Trademarks Logo specifically for 1200x1200
size.




## Artificial Intelligence (A.I) Decrees

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This project deploys the use of one or more generative artificial intelligence
such as but not limited to large language model (LLM) for the following tasks:



### Data Sourcing

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing enhanced web searches due to polluted search engine indexes.
> * Performing completely generated media such as but not limited to images,
>   videos, and audios.

* Used for data and reading material searching as the search engine across the
  Internet had collapsed due to A.I publication slops.
* Used for grammar and language correction detection on the human-made written
  script.



### Data Processing & Analytics

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing development via multi-steps queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding* or *agentic AI processing*).
> * Performing data analytics via multi-steps queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding* or *AI vibing*).
> * Performing dedicated and task specific work where conventional technologies
>   could not achieve such as but not limited to upscaling an image verbatim.

No deployment.



### Data Testing

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing end-user use case simulated testings.

No deployment.



### Data Visualization

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing completely generated data visualization via multi-step queries
>   (also known as *vibe coding*).

No deployment.



### Data Archiving & Deletion

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing data clean-up via multi-step queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding*).

No deployment.




## Maintainers' Notes

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

Please read through Zenodo.org's Trademark Engineering Specification
(https://about.zenodo.org) before editing to avoid any unwanted legal
implications.

While not specified by Zenodo.org, please ensure the outputs are also web ready.
Refer:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/How_to/Define_app_icons
* https://web.dev/articles/maskable-icon
* https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-for-websites/cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image
* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/images/

Please **ONLY USE** open source image editing software specifically:

* **GIMP (https://gimp.org/)** - for their very amazing alternate format exports
  (e.g. `avif`, `webp`, `jpg`, `ico`, and `png`).
* **Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/)** - for vector graphics maintenances and
  exporting SVG plain vector files.

For directory organizations:

* The principal canvas **MUST BE SAVED** in `inkscape SVG format` and retain all
  legal attributes (license, copyright, etc). The files **MUST HAVE** `inkscape-`
  prefixes to avoid confusion. They are saved inside
  `/Pictures/trademarks/principal-canvas` directory.
* The exported svg **MUST BE IN** `Plain SVG format` and retain all legal
  attributes (license, copright, etc). The files **MUST NOT HAVE** `inkscape-`
  prefixes. They are saved inside `/Pictures/trademarks` directory.
* The main-course **MUST** always be `.svg` as end-user can use GIMP to convert
  into other formats.
* Therefore, additional non-text based images (e.g. `.ico`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, and
  `.avif`) should be published in `Release` section as "Good to Have" convenient
  side-dishes.
